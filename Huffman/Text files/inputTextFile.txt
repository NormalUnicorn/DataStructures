[Verse 1]
Do you remember
How it was when you bled
When you loved and burned
In those flames that you kept
Because Vesta's long been sleeping
Now you've come to accept
That anatomy defines more than a few
Of the gaping holes in our social fabric
And it defines more than a few
One-night stands
And I mention more than a few
Prison bars melted into (melted into)
Melted in, melted in
Melted into wedding bands

[Verse 2]
We've made you all the peasants
And we've made ourselves the kings
Our queens
Are still subordinate as an angel (without wings)
But we make it easy to belong
Which means it's easy to be wrong
"Put some plastic in your tits
You'd look better as a blonde"
[Verse 3]
I remember when you were hopeful
Never thought your life would be
Lived inside a coffin, with a moral
Sacrifice, and a million social obligations
Labels and expectations
When you were young and a modern seventeen
In vogue (and vague)
Pursuit (of a)
Cosmopolitan dream

[Bridge]
So when you bled
On the bed
As you fed
Those expectations
As a whore and not a human
You embraced with hesitation
The very parameters of all you can be
Not a mother, not an aunt
Not a sister that's not subdued
Because dignity is not physical
And your flesh means more than you
Your flesh means more than, you
Your flesh means more than you
Your flesh means more than
[Verse 4]
And I know
Know we'll all wake up one day
With a gun to the back of our brains
You'll be asking for your rib
And I'll smile and I'll call you brave
Maybe someday
Maybe someday, when
When this bloody skull has dried
Know our city is in ruins
When our greatest source of pride
A monument of dicks and ribs
And the gender crown we wore
Where underneath, a plaque will read, a plaque will read
"No woman. No woman. No woman
No woman is a whore"

[Outro]
Maybe someday, when
When this bloody skull has dried
Know our city is in ruin
When our greatest source of pride
A monument of dicks and ribs
And the gender crown we wore
Where underneath, a plaque will read, a plaque will read
Maybe someday
Maybe someday, when
When this bloody skull has dried
Know our city is in ruin
When our greatest source of pride
A monument of dicks and ribs
And the gender crown we wore
Where underneath, a plaque will read, a plaque will read
